ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan Schachte and this is the source-code to my blog, or rather, the source code to my playground of applications and projects that I build and deploy to a distributed Kubernetes cluster to try and learn new and fun technologies. Some things you'll most likely find in here are:

- Multi-node cluster configuration for Kubernetes
- Automated dockerization for micro-services running within the cluster
	- Blog
	- Posts
	- Scheduler
	- Video Management
- Java, Node.JS, React, CSS, HTML, Python, other various technology
- Persistent & distributed database setup with Postgres/PGAdmin
